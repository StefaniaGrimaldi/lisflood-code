## About this user guide


This guide is hosted on GitHub Pages platform and it's the most up-to-date and complete user instruction of the LISFLOOD model. 
It contains a detaied step-by-step guide on what you need to do and know through the whole chain from the system requirements to receiving the LISFLOOD output. 

In order to apply this knowledge into practise we included in [Github repository](https://github.com/ec-jrc/lisflood-code) a use case, representing [Drina Catchment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drina). You will find in this guide instructions on how to run the use case on your machine.
For further testing of the LISFLOOD model, you are encouraged to run the [LISFLOOD Use Cases](https://github.com/ec-jrc/lisflood-usecases/).

Once you have mastered this step, you can check and verify that the model has been installed and used by you correctly. 
Then it will be time for you to move onto your own set-up.

In order to ease the set-up of your own catchment we have created another Github repository called [LISFLOOD-Utilities](https://github.com/ec-jrc/lisflood-utilities) that contains all kind of useful tools that should help you preparing your own set-up. A complete documentation is also provided to explain how to use each tool.

Note, this document is **not a LISFLOOD model documentation!**. The [lisflood-model official documentation](https://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-model/) contains the most up-to-date and complete technical documentation of the LISFLOOD model. This includes all the concepts and model equations of all the standard LISFLOOD processes, but also all the optional modules. 

Lastly, we also share with you two other tools: 

* LISVAP, our tool to calculate the evapotranspiration and 
* our calibration tool that we've developed.
 
LISVAP Source code is on LISVAP [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ec-jrc/lisflood-lisvap) while its documentation can be found at [LISVAP GitHub pages](https://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-lisvap/).

Calibration tool source code is on his dedicated [repository](https://github.com/ec-jrc/lisflood-calibration) while documention is at [Calibration Tool GitHub Pages](https://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-calibration/).
